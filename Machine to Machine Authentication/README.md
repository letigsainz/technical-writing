# M2M python library

## Context

During my time on the developer productivity team, I helped create a Python3 library to handle machine to machine (M2M) authentication for internal services.

## Impact

This document served as a reference guide for developers using the M2M requests library. It resulted in widespread adoption of security best practices, as well as an increased level of autonomy across engineering teams.
