# M2M python library

## Context

During my time on the developer productivity team, I helped create a Python3 library to handle machine to machine (M2M) authentication for internal services.

## Impact

This document served as an informative reference guide for developers using M2M requests in their services. Additional documents were created alongside this guide, but I cannot include them due to proprietary content. Because of this, any external links will go nowhere.

## Link to document
